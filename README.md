# TextProcessing - Django web app

## How it looks
![TextProcessingApp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91417fcc-b391-4bfa-8ea0-72f5a9c39f34)

## What the app is doing
My application allows the user to upload a text file (.txt, .html, .css nad .xml). The application reads the file, shuffles the letters in the middle of each word (leaving the first and last letters in place), and displays the modified text to the user. The first view is the form, the second is the result with modified text.

## Technologies
Creating the app required from me knowledge of django, python, html, css. I saved and read the data in / from sqlite database. I handled exceptions. The app is resposive.
